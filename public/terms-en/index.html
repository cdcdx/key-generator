            <h3>
              III. Services</h3>
            <p>
              3.1 Create or import wallet. You may use TokenPocket to create a new wallet or import
              wallets generated by other wallet application. You may only import wallets with Tokens which are supported
              by TokenPocket.<br>
              3.2 Transfer and receive Tokens. You may manage your digital Tokens by using the transfer
              and reception functions of TokenPocket, i.e., you may revise the blockchain ledger by signing with your
              Private Key. Tokens Transfer means the payer transfer the Token to the blockchain address of the payee.
              The actual transfer of Tokens happens on the blockchain system (instead of on TokenPocket).<br>
              3.3 Observe
              the market. You may use TokenPocket to observe the market of the Tokens supported by TokenPocket. The
              quotation of each Token is captured by TokenPocket from corresponding exchange and is displayed in the
              “Markets” column on TokenPocket.<br>
              3.4 Manage Tokens. You may use TokenPocket to add, manage or delete the
              Tokens supported by TokenPocket.<br>
              Browse DApps. Users may use TokenPocket to visit and use the services
              provided by DApps (including DApps developed by TPF and DApps developed by third parties).<br>
              3.5 Browse the
              DApp. Users can link to the DApp and use the services provided by the DApp (including TPF own DApps and
              third-party DApps) through the link on TokenPocket.<br>
              3.6 Transaction records. We will copy all or part of your transaction records from the blockchain system.
              However, Users shall refer to the blockchain system for the latest transaction records.<br>
              3.7 Suspension of
              service. You understand that we are not able to reverse or cancel the transaction because transactions
              based on blockchain technologies are irrevocable. However, under certain circumstances, we may suspend or
              limit the function of TokenPocket used by a particular User.<br>
              3.8 The mobile phone number, email address,
              and the added Owner’s authority required in the registration of TokenPocket (the effective decentralized
              solution under the EOS system) belong to TPF. We will issue you a special note when the registration
              begins. If you choose to use the function, you are treated as having agreed to and recognized all
              terms.<br>
              During the registration using the TokenPocket mobile phone number and email address (the effective
              decentralized solution under the EOS system), your mobile phone or email address will be collected as a
              voucher. The multiple-signature authority of Owner will be added by default to facilitate the retrieval of
              the private key.<br>
              In the registration method using the mobile phone and email address (the effective
              decentralized solution under the EOS system), we will impose the multiple-signature setting to TPF’s Owner
              authority to safeguard users’ authority security to the greatest extent. Additionally, the block
              information is traceable, which enables the largest openness and transparency. The initiator of every
              operation on the account can be checked.<br>
              3.9 Token exchange. Users can exchange tokens with third-party
              smart contracts or third-party DEXs. As an interface tool, TokenPocket is used to help users interact with
              third parties and display the corresponding results of the token exchange.<br>
              3.10 Other services that TPF would like to provide.<br>
              <br>
            </p>
            <h3>
              IV. Users who use TokenPocket must understand that:</h3>
            <p><b>
                4.1 In order to keep the decentralization feature of
                blockchain and to protect the security of your digital Tokens, TPF offers decentralized service which is
                largely different from the banking and financial institutions. Users shall understand that TPF (the
                decentralized solution) DOES NOT provide the following services:<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) store Users’ Wallet Password (the
                password Users set when creating or importing wallets), Private Key, Mnemonic Words or Keystore;<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b)
                restore Users’ Wallet Password, Private Key, Mnemonic Words or Keystore;<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) freeze the wallet;<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) report
                the loss of wallet;<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e) restore the wallet;<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; f) rollback transactions.<br>
                4.2 Users shall take care of their
                mobile devices, back up the TokenPocket App, and back up the Wallet Password, Mnemonic Words, Private
                Key
                and Keystore by themselves. If your mobile device is lost, your TokenPocket App or your wallet is
                deleted
                and not backed up, your wallet is stolen or you forget your Wallet Password, Private Key, Mnemonic Words
                or Keystore, TPF is not able to recover the wallet or restore Wallet Password, Private Key, Mnemonic
                Words
                or Keystore. Nor can TPF cancel transactions for the mishandling of Users (such as typing in wrong
                addresses for transactions).<br>
                4.3 TokenPocket does not support all existing Tokens. Do not use TokenPocket
                to handle any non-supported Tokens.<br>
                4.4 TokenPocket is only a tool for Users to manage their Tokens and is
                not an exchange or a trading platform. For the purpose of this Agreement, the word “transactions” only
                means transferring and receiving Tokens, which is substantially different from transactions on the
                exchanges and trading platforms.<br>
                4.5 The DApps integrated into TokenPocket include those developed
                independently by TPF and those developed by third parties. TokenPocket only acts as a blockchain browser
                for those third-party-developed DApps. Users shall, at their sole discretion, decide whether there would
                be any risks to accept the services provided by or to conduct transactions on the third-party-developed
                DApps.<br>

                You also acknowledge that the market information is captured from exchanges by TokenPocket and may not

                with this Agreement or fails to follow the instructions, tips or rules on the website or on the page of
                the transaction or payment, TokenPocket does not guarantee successful transfer of the Tokens and
                TokenPocket shall not be held liable for any of the consequences of such failure. If you or your
                counterparty has already received the payment in TokenPocket wallet or third-party wallet, you
                understand
                that transactions on blockchain are irreversible and irrevocable. You and your counterparty shall assume

                him/her.<br>
                6.7 You shall check the official blockchain system or other blockchain tools when you receive
                Alert such as “transaction failed” or “mining overtime” in order to avoid repetitive transfer. If you
                fail
                to follow this instruction, you shall bear the losses and expenses occurred due to such repetitive
